The cardioid polar pattern ensures reliable directivity with enhanced rejection of signal at the rear of capsule. Operate the SR-TM1 via 48 VDC phantom power or the internal lithium-ion battery, which delivers up to 150 hours of use and recharges through the supplied micro-USB cable.Selection of the -10 dB pad allows the SR-TM1 to capture loud sound sources without inducing distortion while the 40 Hz to 20 kHz frequency response accurately conveys your source's tone. Customize the SR-TM1's sonic performance with the switchable 150 Hz high-pass filter for minimized low-frequency rumble, and the 6 dB high-frequency boost for improved vocal clarity.Connect the SR-TM1 to your mixer or microphone preamp via the XLR 3-pin output.

The cardioid polar pattern ensures reliable directivity with enhanced rejection of signal at the rear of capsule. Operate the SR-TM1 via 48 VDC phantom power or the internal lithium-ion battery, which delivers up to 150 hours of use and recharges through the supplied micro-USB cable.Selection of the -10 dB pad allows the SR-TM1 to capture loud sound sources without inducing distortion while the 40 Hz to 20 kHz frequency response accurately conveys your source's tone. Customize the SR-TM1's sonic performance with the switchable 150 Hz high-pass filter for minimized low-frequency rumble, and the 6 dB high-frequency boost for improved vocal clarity.Connect the SR-TM1 to your mixer or microphone preamp via the XLR 3-pin output. It includes a foam windscreen, short XLR cable, and mic clip with a camera shoe mount.   \n",

       "4      Dieses Objektiv wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem kompakten, leichten Körper. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit einer erstaunlichen Naheinstellgrenze von nur knapp 1 Zoll.Die SEL30M35 wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem Objektiv ist kompakt, leicht und einfach zu bedienen. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit 2,4 Zentimeter minimale Arbeitsabstand ermöglicht winzigen Themen und details zu erbringenden mit hervorragender Auflösung und Kontrast.1:1 AbbildungsmaßstabDie SEL30M35 hat eine 1:1-Abbildungsmaßstab so, dass die Probanden erfasst werden können, werden in voller Größe auf dem Bildsensor der Kamera. Dies macht es einfach, um zu Schießen Qualität makro-Nahaufnahmen von Blumen, Insekten und kleine Objekte.Asphärische/ED-Glas-ElementeDie SEL30M35 bietet eine hervorragende Bildqualität über den gesamten Bildbereich, mit hohem Kontrast und minimale chromatische aberration von unendlich bis 1:1 Vergrößerung bei allen Blendeneinstellungen. ED-Glas verwendet wird, für die G4-element, minimieren die chromatische aberration und die Farbe Blutungen sowie multi-Beschichtung während für besonders saubere, klare rendering.Gemacht für FilmeDie SEL30M35 ebenso führt auch bei Videoaufnahmen. Dank eines internen Schrittmotor und hinten-mit Schwerpunkt design ist optimiert für video-performance für Laufruhe Grundvoraussetzung für hochwertige Film zu erfassen. Darüber hinaus werden die filter Halterung nicht drehen, während der Schwerpunkt für die problemlose polarisierten filter verwenden.Glatte Manuelle FokussierungEin easy-grip-Fokus-ring auf dem Objektivtubus gibt Ihnen eine Feste \\\"hands-on\\\" fühlen sich in der manuellen Fokussierung. Zusätzlich, Direct Manual Focus (DMF) können Sie den Fokus manuell nach AF lock-on, ohne die Notwendigkeit für einen Wechsel.

       "4      Dieses Objektiv wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem kompakten, leichten Körper. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit einer erstaunlichen Naheinstellgrenze von nur knapp 1 Zoll.Die SEL30M35 wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem Objektiv ist kompakt, leicht und einfach zu bedienen. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit 2,4 Zentimeter minimale Arbeitsabstand ermöglicht winzigen Themen und details zu erbringenden mit hervorragender Auflösung und Kontrast.1:1 AbbildungsmaßstabDie SEL30M35 hat eine 1:1-Abbildungsmaßstab so, dass die Probanden erfasst werden können, werden in voller Größe auf dem Bildsensor der Kamera. Dies macht es einfach, um zu Schießen Qualität makro-Nahaufnahmen von Blumen, Insekten und kleine Objekte.Asphärische/ED-Glas-ElementeDie SEL30M35 bietet eine hervorragende Bildqualität über den gesamten Bildbereich, mit hohem Kontrast und minimale chromatische aberration von unendlich bis 1:1 Vergrößerung bei allen Blendeneinstellungen. ED-Glas verwendet wird, für die G4-element, minimieren die chromatische aberration und die Farbe Blutungen sowie multi-Beschichtung während für besonders saubere, klare rendering.Gemacht für FilmeDie SEL30M35 ebenso führt auch bei Videoaufnahmen. Dank eines internen Schrittmotor und hinten-mit Schwerpunkt design ist optimiert für video-performance für Laufruhe Grundvoraussetzung für hochwertige Film zu erfassen. Darüber hinaus werden die filter Halterung nicht drehen, während der Schwerpunkt für die problemlose polarisierten filter verwenden.Glatte Manuelle FokussierungEin easy-grip-Fokus-ring auf dem Objektivtubus gibt Ihnen eine Feste \\\"hands-on\\\" fühlen sich in der manuellen Fokussierung. Zusätzlich, Direct Manual Focus (DMF) können Sie den Fokus manuell nach AF lock-on, ohne die Notwendigkeit für einen Wechsel.

       "2      Dieses Objektiv wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem kompakten, leichten Körper. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit einer erstaunlichen Naheinstellgrenze von nur knapp 1 Zoll.Die SEL30M35 wurde entwickelt, um bieten vielseitige Hochleistungs-makro-Funktionen in einem Objektiv ist kompakt, leicht und einfach zu bedienen. Es ist eine echte 1:1 makro-Objektiv mit 2,4 Zentimeter minimale Arbeitsabstand ermöglicht winzigen Themen und details zu erbringenden mit hervorragender Auflösung und Kontrast.1:1 AbbildungsmaßstabDie SEL30M35 hat eine 1:1-Abbildungsmaßstab so, dass die Probanden erfasst werden können, werden in voller Größe auf dem Bildsensor der Kamera. Dies macht es einfach, um zu Schießen Qualität makro-Nahaufnahmen von Blumen, Insekten und kleine Objekte.Asphärische/ED-Glas-ElementeDie SEL30M35 bietet eine hervorragende Bildqualität über den gesamten Bildbereich, mit hohem Kontrast und minimale chromatische aberration von unendlich bis 1:1 Vergrößerung bei allen Blendeneinstellungen. ED-Glas verwendet wird, für die G4-element, minimieren die chromatische aberration und die Farbe Blutungen sowie multi-Beschichtung während für besonders saubere, klare rendering.Gemacht für FilmeDie SEL30M35 ebenso führt auch bei Videoaufnahmen. Dank eines internen Schrittmotor und hinten-mit Schwerpunkt design ist optimiert für video-performance für Laufruhe Grundvoraussetzung für hochwertige Film zu erfassen. Darüber hinaus werden die filter Halterung nicht drehen, während der Schwerpunkt für die problemlose polarisierten filter verwenden.Glatte Manuelle FokussierungEin easy-grip-Fokus-ring auf dem Objektivtubus gibt Ihnen eine Feste \\\"hands-on\\\" fühlen sich in der manuellen Fokussierung. Zusätzlich, Direct Manual Focus (DMF) können Sie den Fokus manuell nach AF lock-on, ohne die Notwendigkeit für einen Wechsel.
